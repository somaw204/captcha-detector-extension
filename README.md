## Why Do I Sometimes See "Detection Not Available on This Page"?

Due to browser security policies, the extension **cannot run on certain page types**, including but not limited to:

- **Browser internal pages:**  
  `chrome://extensions/`, `chrome://settings/`, `about:config`, etc.  
- **New tab pages:**  
  `chrome://newtab/`, `about:newtab`, and custom new tab extensions.  
- **Extension stores:**  
  Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons store pages.  
- **Local files:**  
  `file://` URLs require special permissions.  
- **SSL error pages:**  
  Pages like "Your connection is not private".  
- **Sites with strict Content Security Policy (CSP) or sandboxed iframes.**

### What‚Äôs New in This Version Regarding This?

- Improved error handling to detect and report why detection is unavailable.  
- Disabled controls on restricted pages to avoid confusion.  
- Clear, informative feedback displayed in the popup.

## Troubleshooting Guide

For detailed info on restrictions and how to test:

- Use regular websites like `google.com`, `github.com`, or news sites.  
- For local files, enable **"Allow access to file URLs"** in your browser extension settings.  
- For development, serve local files via HTTP (e.g., `python -m http.server`) instead of opening directly.
